Release Notes:
============================================================================================================================================
VehiculoVigilanciaAutonomo_v0.6:
     - Developed in the Sprint 5.
     - Supports the use of the microphones array of the Kinect by detecting a wake-word after which the user can record a 4 seconds audio clip
       with a voice command.
     - Introduces a Mobile Client App that supports the use of the microphone of the mobile phone to record voice commands.
     - The voice commands are processed by the Speech Recognition node in the package vva_voice_interact_laptop. This node is based on
       Mozilla DeepSpeech v0.6.1 and currently supports only american english language.
     - All the audio clips captured throught the microphones array of the Kinect are saved and preserved for future use as datasets for
       training DeepSpeech. The audio clips captured through the Mobile App are not preserved.
     - Introduces an architecture to implement the Intent Recognition, to interpret the Voice Commands. Several Intent Recognition nodes can be
       deployed in the package vva_user_intents, each node specialized in different tasks. Currently, there is only one node in charge of the
       navigation related tasks.
     - The Intent Recognition node in charge of the navigation tasks (vva_navigation_intent.py) supports the following commands: "navigate to",
       "start patrolling" and "stop navigation".
     - The known issue of v0.5 regading vva_navigation_correction not working on simulation is now fixed.
     - The launch files "vva_odom_correction.launch", "vva_move_base.launch" and "vva_navigation_correction.launch" were consolidated in
       one launch file called "vva_consolidated_nav.launch".
     
     - Pre-requisites:
          - Use the last version of rtabmap, which is downloaded from github and compile. The version that comes in the Ubuntu Bionic repos doesn't
            have the module "rgbd_relay". This is found in: "$ROS_HOME_WS/ROSCompiledPackages/ROSCompiledPackages_ws/src/rtabmap_ros/"
          - Use the package depth_nav_tools/laserscan_kinect, it is not available in Melodic but it can be downloaded and compiled. It is found in:
            "$ROS_HOME_WS/ROSCompiledPackages/ROSCompiledPackages_ws/src/depth_nav_tools/laserscan_kinect/"
          - If you want to make a modification of the request or the response of the ROS Service used in the Mobile App, then rosjava is needed to
            generate the .jar file. It is found in: "$ROS_HOME_WS/ROSCompiledPackages/rosjava_minimal"

     - Known issues:
          - The model is not shown in Gazebo, when the joints are of type "revolute". For example, this happened with the joints between the
            Kinect and the base.
          - vva_cliff_detector doesn't work when simulated in Gazebo, it shows the error: "Could not perform stairs detection:
            Depth image has unsupported encoding: 32FC1"
          - Sometimes the depth image transmission has interruptions or it just doesn't arrive any more, hence the navigation stack
            stops working. The cause of this issue is unknown so far, maybe it is due to the weakness of the WiFi signal in some locations.
          - When voice commands are captured using the microphones array of the Kinect, the Speech Recognition doesn't work accurately. Maybe
            due to the environmental noise and because the microphones are far from the person speaking.

============================================================================================================================================
VehiculoVigilanciaAutonomo_v0.6.1:
     - Developed in the Sprints 2 and 2.1.
     - All the ROS packages and nodes that were previously intended to run on the Raspberry Pi or the Laptop, were migrated to run on the
       Nvidia Jetson Nano (J-Nano). Except by rviz, rtabmapviz and the teleop.
     - When running on hardware, the state publishers are now started from ‚Äúvva_jnano_consolidated/ vva_jnano_lowlevel_consolidated.launch‚Äù.
       when running on simulation, they are started from ‚Äúvva_description/ rviz_rtabmap_simulation.launch‚Äù.
     - The version of rtabmap used is v0.20, which comes in the apt repos. Is no longer required to compile it because the "rgbd_relay" node
       is not used, because all the nodes run on the same computer (J-Nano).
     - Two new launch files were done to decouple the rtabmap (in the J-Nano) and rtabmapviz (in the Laptop): "vva_rtabmap_hw.launch" and
       "vva_rtabmapviz_hw.launch". The simulation will be managed in a separate launch file: "vva_rtabmap_simulation.launch".
     - DeepSpeech was decoupled from the package "vva_voice_interact_server" (previously called "vva_voice_interact_laptop"), now it runs as
       an independent process under Python 3.7 (ROS Melodic runs on Python 2.7). The communication between DeepSpeech and ROS is done using
       sockets and a shared file. DeepSpeech version used: v0.8.2.
     - The package "vva_voice_interact_server" now notifies the user through the Kinect's LED when a voice command is received and if it was
       recognized as a valid command or not.
     - The URDF model was updated to match the new vehicle, called VAA (Vehiculo de Asistencia Autonomo), based on the vehicle design number 6.
       CAD file: "20201001_NuevoHW_diseno6_v2.1.2_temp.FCStd".
     - A new teleop node is available. This can move the vehicle in curves combining translation and rotation.
       To invoke use: "roslaunch vva_nav_test vva_teleop3.launch".
     - An Arduino Mega2560 is now used to manage all the low level tasks, and to avoid the usage of the GPIO ports of the J-Nano, to prevent
       damages in the J-Nano due to over-voltages.
     - The package "vva_base_controller" was modified to split the functionality with the Arduino. The communication with the Arduino is
       implemented using "rosserial_arduino".
     - The wheels calibration is now automatically done when "vva_base_controller.launch" is launched and it detects that the calibration
       parameters file is not present. There is no need for a separate launch file for calibration.
     - The wheels PID controller implemented in the package "vva_base_controller" was modified, it now has two sets of coefficients: one for
       in place rotation and other for translation. This because the conditions of friction in these two situations are very different.
     - The node "vva_topicAnalyzerForAccelLimits.py" now calculates the acceleration limits and prints them in the screen.
       To invoke: "rosrun vva_nav_test vva_topicAnalyzerForAccelLimits.py"
     - The bash script "RunAsBackgroundScript/runVVA_ROSNodesOnBackground.sh" is now available to start all the nodes in the background.
       It has 4 options: "start_mapping", "start_navigation", "status" and "stop"
     - The node ‚Äúvva_navigation/ vva_navigation_correction.py‚Äù was modified to stop the RP-Lidar when there is no any goal in progress.
     - A watchdog crontab script was done to monitor the status of the WiFi connection and restart the WiFi interface if the connectivity fails.
       Name of the script: "EmailNotificationAndWatchdogScripts/WiFiWatchdog.sh".
     - The package "vva_robot_healthcheck" was added to receive the status of the WiFi from the watchdog script and notify the user through the
       Kinect's LED and tilt.
     - The node "vva_user_intents/ vva_navigation_intent.py" was modified to transform all the goals to the "map" frame.
     
     - Pre-requisites:
          - Use the package depth_nav_tools/laserscan_kinect, it is not available in Melodic but it can be downloaded and compiled. It is found in:
            "$ROS_HOME_WS/ROSCompiledPackages/ROSCompiledPackages_ws/src/depth_nav_tools/laserscan_kinect/"
          - If you want to make a modification of the request or the response of the ROS Service used in the Mobile App, then rosjava is needed to
            generate the .jar file. It is found in: "$ROS_HOME_WS/ROSCompiledPackages/rosjava_minimal"

	   - Included ROS packages:
          vva_base_controller - Control of the wheels and communication with the Arduino Mega2560.
          vva_cliff_detector - This module is a fork of the code of depth_nav_tools to slightly change the behavior regarding the topics.
                               It is in charge of detecting holes or cliffs.
          vva_cliff_detector_layer - Fork of the code of depth_nav_tools to reduce the verbosty of the module. It is in charge of including
                                     the holes and cliffs in the costmap.
          vva_description - Contains the URDF model and the launch files for rviz.
          vva_gazebo - Gazebo worlds.
          vva_jnano_consolidated - Consolidated launch file that starts in the J-Nano: Base controller, OpenNI Kinect, kinect_aux, RP-Lidar, state publisher.
          vva_kinect_aux - In charge of changing the tilt of the Kinect and of publishing the position of the joints according with the
                           Kinect's IMU.
          vva_lidar_filter - LaserScans filter used to reduce the angle covered by the laserscan_kinect and hence remove the noise generated
                             by the Kinect in a small section of the field of view.
          vva_lidar_odom - LaserScan based odometry, uses the icp_odometry module of rtabmap.
          vva_msgs - Package that contains the defintions of the customized messages and services used in VVA.
          vva_navigation - Contains the modules related to the mapping, localization and navigation stack, including rtabmap and move_base.
          vva_nav_test - Manual control of the robot based on the keyboard arrow keys and also by scripting. It also contains a node to
                         generate customized statistics in tables based on selected topics.
          vva_robot_healthcheck - Receives services and topics with reports of the health of the system and provides feedback to the user using
                                  the Kinect's LED or any other available means.
          vva_rplidar_ros - Fork of the rplidar_ros package. It is modified to add options that enable the change of the values of the Lidar intensities.
          vva_topics_sync - Package that uses message_filters to synchronize the image_raw and camera_info topics generated by the Kinect.
                            Useful when the Kinect is in a remote node.
          vva_user_intents - This package contains nodes in charge of the execution of actions identified during the Intent Recognition. Besides
                             is responsible for the high level behaviors of the robot.
          vva_voice_interact_client - This node is in charge of interfacing with the microphones array of the Kinect and perform the wake-word detection,
                                      which is based on Porcupine. This package is not compatible with J-Nano, see the "Known issues" section.
          vva_voice_interact_server - This package receives an audio clip through a ROS service and invokes the DeepSpeech module to perform the 
                                      Automatic Speech Recognition. It also performs the mapping between audio transcripts and intent services.
                                      
     - Known issues:
          - The model is not shown in Gazebo, when the joints are of type "revolute". For example, this happened with the joints between the
            Kinect and the base.
          - vva_cliff_detector doesn't work when simulated in Gazebo, it shows the error: "Could not perform stairs detection:
            Depth image has unsupported encoding: 32FC1"
          - Sometimes the depth image transmission has interruptions or it just doesn't arrive any more, hence the navigation stack
            stops working. The cause of this issue is unknown so far, maybe it is due to the weakness of the WiFi signal in some locations.
          - The package "vva_voice_interact_client" (previously called "vva_voice_interact_rbpi") didn't work on the J-Nano because the wake-word
            detection program, Porcupine, didn't have a compatible version for arm64 architecture.
            - When voice commands are captured using the microphones array of the Kinect, the Speech Recognition doesn't work accurately. Maybe
              due to the environmental noise and because the microphones are far from the person speaking.
          - When running on the J-Nano, the depth image of the Kinect doesn't work properly when the argument ‚Äúdepth_registration‚Äù is set to "true"
            when using the package "openni_launch". This didn't happen on the RbPi. This was avoided using other available topics.
          - The odometry based on Lidar (vva_lidar_odom) gets lost when the vehicle follows a curved trajectory (translation + rotation).
